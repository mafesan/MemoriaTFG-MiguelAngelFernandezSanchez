% #TODO Ask for resources to back this data:
The way people develop software has evolved during these years: there is an extended social perception of developers to
be ingoing, solitary people, with very few social skills. But this sense is outdated: the paradigm has changed,
as coding has become almost a social activity. Developers who work collaborating with others produce better software [resource], as they
are continuously reading code from other developers, getting feedback about their contributions and consequently
widening their knowledge with new procedures and ideas. It turns out that this is how most of the software is produced nowadays,
so it is very difficult to become a successful developer without having good social skills.\\
If we think on social, virtual interactions among people, the first thing that probably come to our minds will be
"Social networks". It is clear that those so-called social networks have produced a huge impact among a big part of the
population; changing daily habits, affecting real-life relationships, etc. As individuals, we share personal information every
day using interactive applications which allows us to participate somehow into a social network. As a result of handle these
applications, we make specific interactions as users. \\
Let's see some examples. If we focus on Twitter, some of these interactions can be:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Follow a Twitter user.
    \item \textit{Retweet} a \textit{tweet} (propagate a message among all followers of the person who retwitted).
    \item Use a \textit{hashtag} (a word preceded by a hash \# to label or classify a message into a topic).
\end{itemize}
Whereas on Facebook, we have other kinds of interactions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item React to a post.
    \item Tag a person in a picture.
    \item Write a comment on someone's profile.
\end{itemize}
Talking about coding, in the last few years we've seen how this social trend came to software with the
emergence of social coding platforms, such as GitHub, BitBucket, GitLab, etc.\\
Social interactions in these platforms are about how software is developed and maintained but also how
contributions are managed (code review, continuous integration, etc.).\\
So for example, on GitHub\footnote{\url{https://github.com}} we can find interactions like:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Fork} a repository (create an editable copy of a project).
    \item See changes from last \textit{commit} (difference between most recent version and last version of the project).
    \item Watch the contributors of a repository.
    \item Submit a \textit{Pull Request} (proposal to merge changes in a project).
\end{itemize}
These interactions that were mentioned, no matter their source, leave traces which remain stored in some computer on Earth.
This means we can obtain these data (though not all of it is publicly available) through the Internet using an \emph{API}
(\textit{Application programming interface}).\\
Once this information is retrieved, we can analyse it and extract conclusions about it.

\section{Free/Libre/Open-Source Software}
\label{sec:floss-definition}
In the following sections we are going to talk about software and its development process, focused on \emph{FLOSS} (Free/Libre, Open-source
software) projects, so it is inevitable to describe briefly what is this about.
During my degree, I was fortunate to be taught within \emph{FLOSS} values, as most of my professors plead
for Free/Libre software as their teaching model, by which I have obtained a distinctive knowledge and perspective as a professional but also as a individual.\\\\\\
According to the \textbf{Free Software Foundation}\footnote{\url{https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html}}:
\begin{displayquote}
    \emph{Free software} means software that respects users' freedom and community. Roughly, it means that the users have the freedom
    to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software. Thus, free software is a matter of liberty, not price.\\
    \ldots\\
    A program is free software if the program's users have the four essential freedoms:
       \begin{itemize}
           \item The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).
           \item The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1).
           \item The freedom to redistribute copies (freedom 2).
           \item The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3).
       \end{itemize}
    A program is free software if it gives users adequately all of these freedoms. Otherwise, it is \textit{nonfree}.
\end{displayquote}
% #TODO:
Due to the connotations which the word \emph{Free} has in english language (mentioned before), there is a definition
for \emph{Open source} software by the \textbf{Open Source Initiative}\footnote{\url{https://opensource.org/osd}} which
slighly varies from the \emph{FSF} definition. About this difference Richard Stallman, founder of the \emph{FSF}, comments:
\begin{displayquote}
The term \emph{open source} software is used by some people to mean more or less the same category as free software.
It is not exactly the same class of software: they accept some licences that we consider too restrictive,
and there are free software licences they have not accepted. However, the differences in extension of the
category are small: nearly all free software is open source, and nearly all open source software is free.
\end{displayquote}

\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:motivation}
I was working as a Researcher Assistant in GSyC/LibreSoft\footnote{\url{http://www.libresoft.es}} department at Rey Juan Carlos University when I started to
deepen into Free/Libre software and the world of metrics. Then I had the great luck of start participating in a study that
Dr. Gregorio Robles was doing with researchers from Chalmers University in Gothenburg, Sweden. The main aim of their research was to
learn how \emph{UML} models\footnote{\url{http://uml.org/what-is-uml.htm}} are used in public \emph{FLOSS} projects (particularly, projects hosted on GitHub),
as most of the previous studies focused only on its industrial use.\\
Given the large size of GitHub as a platform and its access limitations, this research motivated to build a tool which allows to
extract data from all the existing repositories on GitHub, then filter those repositories which may include at least one
\emph{UML} model and finally analyze more in-depth the set of projects that meet this condition.\\\\
Since early stages of this research, this tool was designed and built using a modular structure, thought to be re-used
and adaptable (according to the kind of files that have to be found and the way GitHub provides data) hoping to be useful
for other researches or any other person who might be interested on extract this information. Besides, the scale of this project
presented to me as a personal challenge which provided me the opportunity to extend my knowledge and obtain a valuable point of
view about research and large-scope projects.

\section{Structure of the dissertation}
\label{sec:estructura}
During this dissertation I'm going to explain the different objectives that were stated for this project, the technology
which have been used and explain an use case, taking into account the limitations and issues which arose
during this project and how they were solved.\\Then, discuss about results from the use case and general conclusions
and to finish, consider future work and further steps for this project.

\section{Python}
\label{sec:python}
Python\footnote{\url{https://www.python.org/}} is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level, open source
programming language for general-purpose programming created by Guido van Rossum in 1991 (Nowadays, the most
recent version is 3.6, from December, 2016).\ Its design is focused on code readability and clear syntax, making
possible to program using fewer lines of code comparing to other programming languages as C++ or Ada.\
%Python is widely used over the world, for example: Numeric and Scientific Programming, ... \\

Python features a large standard library, which includes many different tasks from text pattern matching to network
scripting, in addition to a vast collection of third-party application libraries.
Other remarkable features are portability, as Python interpreters are available for many operating systems;
and the component integration, as Python scripts can easily communicate with other parts of an application or code,
like C++ libraries, MySQL databases, etc.\\
%As a downside to Python is that its execution speed may not always be as fast as a compiled, lower-level
%slanguages such as C and C++.\\

\subsection{PyGithub module}
\label{sec:pygithub}

\section{Git}
\label{sec:git}
Git is an open source version control system originally developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds. \
It's by far, the most used VSC in the world\footnote{\url{http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2015}}

\section{Github}
\label{sec:github}

\subsection{Github API}

\section{GH Torrent}
\label{sec:ghtorrent}
GH Torrent is a project based on create a scalable, queriable, offline mirror of data offered through the Github REST API.\\
As they explain in their website\footnote{\url{http://ghtorrent.org/}}, GHTorrent monitors the Github public event time line.
For each event, it retrieves its contents and their dependencies, exhaustively. It then stores the raw JSON responses to a MongoDB
database, while also extracting their structure in a MySQL database.\
For each release, you can download a MySQL (full database, using one CSV file per table) or a MongoDB dump (incremental database).\\

\label{sec:consecucion-objetivos}

Esta secci�n es la secci�n espejo de las dos primeras del cap�tulo de objetivos,
donde se planteaba el objetivo general y se elaboraban los espec�ficos.

Es aqu� donde hay que debatir qu� se ha conseguido y qu� no. Cuando algo no
se ha conseguido, se ha de justificar, en t�rminos de qu� problemas se han
encontrado y qu� medidas se han tomado para mitigar esos problemas.


\section{Knowledge application}
\label{sec:aplicacion}

Aqu� viene lo que has aprendido durante el Grado/M�ster y que has aplicado
en el TFG/TFM. Una buena idea es poner las asignaturas m�s relacionadas y
comentar en un p�rrafo los conocimientos y habilidades puestos en pr�ctica.

\section{Future work}
\label{sec:trabajos_futuros}

Ning�n software se termina, as� que aqu� vienen ideas y funcionalidades
que estar�a bien tener implementadas en el futuro.

Es un apartado que sirve para dar ideas de cara a futuros TFGs/TFMs.


\section{Personal assessment}
\label{sec:valoracion}

Finalmente (y de manera opcional), hay gente que se anima a dar su punto de
vista sobre el proyecto, lo que ha aprendido, lo que le gustar�a haber aprendido,
las tecnolog�as utilizadas y dem�s.
